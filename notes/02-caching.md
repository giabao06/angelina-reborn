# caching stuff

```
i.e. how to make stuff work fast
```

## 0. command info for help cmd

```json
//:shrug:
```
- on startup, recache all this information
- when calling help, show cmdname and desc based on this info 
- not doing this on a db because the info is temporary (it makes testing cmds easy too)

## 1. xkcd caching

```json
:shrug:
```

- on startup and every few days, recache
