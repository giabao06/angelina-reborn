# angelina-reborn

[Angelina-chan](https://github.com/SakanaKochiya/angelina-chan-sc), but rewritten and uses a sqlite db. Licensed under the MIT License

## why rewrite?
this project is more like `"my mind went nuts recently plus i just learned sql so i want to put it into use"`. also great opportunity for me to learn/practice js and sql.

i also wanted to do a lot more that the old one can't do. there's also a lot of other stuff that needed a rewrite anyway (*cough cough* gacha command)

## main goals

- readable, scalable code (not everything should be hardcoded)
- store stuff in a db (i.e. admin roles, operator info, etc.)
- some dynamic stuff (i.e. the help command should autoload cmd info from the files themselves)
- actually making xkcd caching work
- avoid if-else chains
- a working gacha command with editable banners

## deployment instructions
should be the same as the other angelina. though I will add the config stuff later
